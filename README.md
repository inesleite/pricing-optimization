Two-sided ride-hailing marketplace, meaning that we need to balance the needs and demands of both drivers and passengers. 

On one side of the marketplace, we have passengers who rely on the platform to quickly and conveniently find rides. They expect a seamless experience, with minimal waiting times and reasonable prices.
On the other side, we have drivers, who use the platform to find passengers and generate income. Their needs include a steady stream of ride requests with fair compensation.

Dynamic pricing plays a critical role in maintaining this balance. By adjusting prices in real-time based on supply and demand, we can incentivise drivers to be available on the platform during high-demand periods, ensuring that passengers can find rides quickly even when the need is greatest.
Moreover, dynamic pricing helps manage demand by moderating the number of ride requests. When demand is exceptionally high, slightly higher prices can prevent the system from becoming overloaded with requests, thus maintaining service quality and availability. Conversely, during low-demand periods, lower prices can attract more passengers, ensuring that drivers still have enough ride requests to remain active and profitable.
